          A buyer may, by agreement with the seller, elect to make payment by cash, check or other payment method accepted by the seller. Such payments are made directly between the buyer and the seller when they meet in person to complete their purchase and sale transaction, pursuant to terms they determine.

A buyer and seller may instead pay with and accept credit cards and other electronic payment methods (each an “Electronic Payment Method”) through the Knot Complex Service.

        <p>
          <strong>Sellers: </strong>
In order to accept electronic payment from Buyers through the Knot Complex Service , you will need to create a seller payment account (“Stripe Account”) with Stripe in accordance with Stripe’s enrollment criteria and terms of service.

Knot Complex is not a party to any agreement between you and Stripe and will not be liable or responsible for the payment of services provided by Stripe.

            <li>your physical or electronic signature; </li>

        <h4>17.	Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration.</h4>
        <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong>
        <br>
        <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>
        <p>
          This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.”  You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Knot Complex, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Knot Complex Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.  Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.  You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Knot Complex are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>
        <strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong>
          <p>
            YOU AND KNOT COMPLEX AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  UNLESS BOTH YOU AND KNOT COMPLEX AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
          </p>
          <strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong>
          <p>
            Knot Complex is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at [______________].  If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).  The Notice to Knot Complex should be sent to [__________________] (“Notice Address”).  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  If Knot Complex and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Knot Complex may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Knot Complex or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Knot Complex is entitled.
          </p>
          <strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>
          <p>
            Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.  Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.  The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.  Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless Knot Complex and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.  If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.  If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Knot Complex agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
          </p>
          <strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>
          <p>
            Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Knot Complex will pay all Arbitration Fees.  If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Knot Complex will pay your portion of such fees.  In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Knot Complex will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
          </p>
          <strong> Confidentiality</strong>
          <p>
            All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
          </p>
          <strong>Severability</strong>
          <p>
            If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.  The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.
          </p>
          <strong>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, Knot Complex agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Knot Complex Services, you may reject any such change by sending Knot Complex written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
          </p>
          <h4>18.	User Disputes.</h4>
          <p>
            You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Knot Complex Service and Knot Complex will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.  Knot Complex reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Knot Complex Service.
          </p>
          <h4>19.	General.</h4>
          <p>
            These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Knot Complex and govern your use of the Knot Complex Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Knot Complex with respect to the Knot Complex Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Knot Complex agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Mateo County, California. The failure of Knot Complex to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Knot Complex Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of Knot Complex, but Knot Complex may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Knot Complex Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Knot Complex Service.
