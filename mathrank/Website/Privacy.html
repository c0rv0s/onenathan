    <h1 class="title text-center">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>LAST UPDATED: March 24, 2016</p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and
          disclosed by Knot Complex, Inc. (hereafter “Knot Complex”, “our,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy
          Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website, mobile applications and other online services (collectively, the “Knot Complex Service”) or when you otherwise interact with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
            If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and,
            in some cases, we may provide you with more prominent notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage
            or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access
            the Knot Complex Service to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>
        <p>
          Note: Knot Complex is piloting a new electronic payments solution that is only available to certain users. As a result, some of the provisions of this privacy policy related to the payments solution may not apply to all users.
        </p>

        <p>
            2.2. <strong>Device Information:</strong>
            We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Knot Complex Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.

            2.3. <strong>Location Information:</strong>
            If you consent to the collection of location information from your computer or mobile device, we may collect this information when you access or use the Knot Complex Service, or when you otherwise consent to the collection of this information.

        </p>
        <p>
            2.4. <strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</strong>
           We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that helps us to improve the Knot Complex Service and your experience, see which areas and features of the Knot Complex Service are popular and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “gifs,” “pixel tags” and “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in the Knot Complex Service or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Your Information Choices” below.        </p>

        <p>
            3. <strong>Information from Third Parties.</strong>
            Knot Complex may, from time to time, obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Knot Complex Service in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site. We may also receive transaction information from Stripe Inc. when you purchase or sell a good using the Knot Complex payment solution, including the date and time of sale and the amount of the sale.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <strong>Payment Information Collected by Stripe.</strong>
            Knot Complex is integrated with Stripe Inc.’s (“Stripe”) services to allow sellers to accept credit card and other electronic payment methods for goods they list for sale on the Knot Complex Service. Stripe provides these services directly to sellers pursuant to its own terms and privacy policy. When signing up to receive funds electronically, Stripe, and not Knot Complex, collects some of the information provided by sellers via the Knot Complex Service, including debit card numbers, Social Security numbers, government IDs, and bank account information. For more information about the third-party payment processing services integrated with the Knot Complex Service, please see our FAQs.
