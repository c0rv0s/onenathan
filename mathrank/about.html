			<p>
				Mathrank was founded on a simple concept, save teachers money by making web based worksheets for elementary school students.
				Teachers spend as much as several hundred dollars a year on printing costs and far too many hours searching for the right problems at the right price.
				MathRank makes learning easy. Infinite problem sets and instant feedback means kids learn faster and have more fun along the way.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Our Story</h4>
			<p>
				MathRank was started from a simple question, how can we make teacher's lives better while getting students to love their time at school? With more and more schools adopting technology in their classrooms the time has never been better to revolutionize education. MathRank takes the expense out of teaching and the
				dryness out of homework. With inexpensive subscriptions and infinite questions one assignment takes a tenth of the toll on the teacher and engages each student far beyond what traditional
				means were ever capable of. Welcome to the future.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Our Mission</h4>
			<p>
				It's a proven fact that repeated practice cements new information in the brain, nowhere is this more important than K-12 children where their minds are at their most malleable.
				Boring classwork makes for inattentive students. Interactive problem sets keep the focus on the learning and reward success with continuous engagement and iterative advancement.
				When education is so important, why make it a chore?
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Our Commitment</h4>
			<p>
				We're showing you the way it could be and it doesn't come without a price. Innovation is a choice we have to make and the time has never been better to seize the chance. More students than ever have access to the web and more teachers are looking for cheaper faster learning tools with higher engagement than ever before.
				At MathRank, making tools that are engaging and entertaining is in our DNA. Learning is a right, not a privilege and when the best tools are also the most accesible you know that you'll always be able to empower your students in the best way possible.
